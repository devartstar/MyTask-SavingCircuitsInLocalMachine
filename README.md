# MyTask-SavingCircuitsInLocalMachine

Saving as SVG.
We already have the functionality of downloading circuits as SVG.
In FabricJS while uploading the SVG we have the option for grouping and ungrouping of the elements of the SVG.
By ungrouping the elements of the circuit before uploading it on screen we can keep intact all its properties.
